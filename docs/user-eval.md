## 01: User Evaluation of Flashcard Deck Management

### Meta


Status
: **Done**


Updated
: 20-JUL-2024


### Goal


The goal is to evaluate the efficiency and user satisfaction with managing flashcard decks, including the creation, editing, and handling of individual flashcard decks and flashcards.
Specifically, we aim to identify any common obstacles or frustrations encountered during the process.


### Method


+ Participant Recruitment:
 + Recruit at least 5 users of different ages and segments of our target audience
+ Task Description:
 + Instruct participants to create two new flashcard decks, add at least 5 flashcards to each, and then edit the decks and its flashcards.
+ Observation:
 + Observe each participant as they complete the tasks. Record any difficulties or questions they have.
+ User Feedback:
 + After the tasks, gather detailed feedback on their experience, difficulties faced, and suggestions for improvement.


### Results


The evaluation revealed that the overall process of creating and editing flashcard decks is intuitive for most users.
However, significant areas for improvement were identified. Users highlighted the inability to change the name of flashcard decks after creation as a major issue. Additionally, the "Back" button's ambiguity caused confusion, making it unclear how to return to the overview of all decks or navigate back from the edit mode if users decided not to add a card.
These issues were consistently pointed out in user feedback.


### Implications


We will aim to improve the user experience by implementing a clear and prominent "Back" button that allows users to return to the previous page. Additionally, we will introduce the functionality to edit the names of flashcard decks after their creation.
These changes are expected to enhance the overall usability and satisfaction of our application.

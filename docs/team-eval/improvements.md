We are very satisfied with our performance and the outcome of our work. We had plenty of time because we started the development process very early. However, upon reflection, we identified several areas for potential improvement that could enhance our future projects:
## Project Management Tools:
In the future, we could consider using additional project management tools like Kanban. This would help in organizing our tasks more effectively, visualizing our progress, and managing the workflow efficiently. Implementing Kanban could ensure that all team members are aware of their responsibilities and the current status of the project, leading to a more streamlined development process.
## Branching Strategy:
We would implement features and fix bugs using separate branches instead of doing everything in the master branch. This practice would help maintain the stability and functionality of the main branch, as new features and bug fixes can be thoroughly tested in isolated environments before being merged. This approach reduces the risk of introducing errors into the master branch and makes it easier to manage the codebase.
## Test Coverage:
We did not conduct software tests in this project. In the future, we would aim to achieve higher test coverage to ensure that all possible error cases are covered. By incorporating comprehensive software testing, we can catch potential bugs earlier in the development process, leading to a more robust and reliable application. Implementing tests also helps maintain code quality and provides confidence when making changes or adding new features.

By focusing on these areas, we believe that we can improve the efficiency, reliability, and quality of our future projects, ultimately delivering better outcomes.

## Main Goals:
Our primary goal was to ensure the functionality and complete a minimal viable product (MVP). For our flashcard web application, this included the creation and editing of flashcards, enabling users to effectively learn and browse flashcards created by other users.

We successfully achieved all these objectives:
+ Creation and Editing of Flashcards: 
  + Users can easily create, edit, and delete flashcards.
+ Effective Learning: 
  + The application allows users to study and review their flashcards efficiently.
+ Browsing Flashcards: 
  + Users can browse and use flashcards created by other users, fostering a collaborative learning environment.
+ User Interface: 
  + We also managed to design an appealing and user-friendly interface.


Due to time constraints caused by other university projects, we were unable to include gamification elements. We chose to focus on the core functionalities instead, which we successfully implemented.
